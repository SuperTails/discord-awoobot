# discord-awoobot
A bot for a Discord server based off r/furry_irl

## Context
Within furry culture, there is a thing, "awooing", based on wolves and dogs that howl. Another "fully culture thing" is a movement to "legalize awoo", as awooing is illegal and incurs a $350 fine. (All of this not actually real, in case it was not obvious.)

In Ancient Egyptian culture, there is a god named "Anubis", who is half man, half dog. A redditor on r/furry_irl created an account named "Awoobis", as a portmanteau of "Awoo" and "Anubis". People (er, "people") on r/furry_irl began to revere Awoobis as a god, and the "legalize awoo" movement began to grow and use Awoobis as a backing.

Eventually, with lots of people on the subreddit in this movement, a Discord server for the movement was created, attracting Awoobis himself along with over 200 other people (yes, seriously). [(Original post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/furry_irl/comments/954avs/furry_irl/)

One of the roles in this server is the "worshipers" role, which is given to anyone who is a follower. However, with the server's quickly growing size when I joined (there were 19 people and around 60 when I created the bot) it became too much for two people to handle, and Awoobot was created. Initially, it simply gave the worshipers role to anyone who typed "Hail Awoobis" in the server, although now it has a scoreboard (and cooldown) of who has hailed the most and other functions.
